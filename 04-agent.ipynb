In large projects or when numerous roles are present, it is easy to miss or improperly perform role checks ([OWASP C7: Enforce Access Controls](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/v3/en/c7-enforce-access-controls)). This can result in both too much and too little access. This is especially true in RBAC implementations where a role hierarchy is not present and multiples role checks must be chained to have the desired impact (i.e. ( `if(user.hasAnyRole(\"SUPERUSER\", \"ADMIN\", \"ACCT_MANAGER\")` ))).\\\\n- **Speed**. In RBAC, \"role explosion\" can occur when a system defines too many roles. If users send their credential and roles through means like HTTP headers, which have size limits, there may not be enough space to include all of the user\\\\\\'s roles. A viable workaround to this problem is to only send the user ID, and then the application retrieves the user\\\\\\'s roles, but this will increase the latency of every request.\\'), Document(metadata={\\'course_content_id\\': 3, \\'title\\': \\'Authentication Cheat Sheet\\'}, page_content=\"It is a good idea to do this when:\\\\n\\\\n- It is acceptable (or even preferred) that the user has access to the website only from a single computer/browser.\\\\n- The user is not easily scared by the process of installing TLS certificates on his browser, or there will be someone, probably from IT support, who will do this for the user.\\\\n- The website requires an extra step of security.\\\\n- It is also a good thing to use when the website is for an intranet of a company or organization.\\\\n\\\\nIt is generally not a good idea to use this method for widely and publicly available websites that will have an average user.
